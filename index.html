        <p>
            Spirit of the Place is an experimental project about creating a network of "Spirits" -
            artificially-intelligent entities scattered around our cities, with each Spirit
            personifying the character and representing the community of a single area
        </p>

        <p>
            Spirits are like ghosts inhabiting places - buildings, streets, trees - but you can talk
            to them, ask them for recent local news, share a story. A Spirit can be interacted with
            by anyone who is in the place where the Spirit lives.

        <p>
            We are starting with creating the first Spirit in Dalston, London. Local residents will
            be able to interact with the Spirit using augmented reality (AR) technology on their phones.
